## How to Build

The "node_modules" folder is removed due to its huge size. You may run the following command in the project folder to install those modules.

__Attention__: Please install "node.js" and "npm" in advance.

`npm install`

## How to Run

The back-end server should be started firstly.

In the project folder, execute the following command to run this Angular front-end.

`ng serve`

## Possible Bugs

Both the front-end and the back-end are built in the development mode. If they are built for the production mode, the cross-orgin requests may not work.
